Repository w/ code, data, viz for Project 4 :

A Computational Literary History of Gender in fiction 

This project proposes an overview of the methods used in the computational literary studies. We will apply Text Mining, NLP & Machine Learning techniques to model concepts in large literary corpora. We will focus on the notion of gender and try to evaluate the strength of gender stereotypes over literary history. We will pass through the process used in the field, from meta-data collection, data annotation, to NLP techniques implementation, predictive modelling and interpretative analysis of our results. Several tasks will be in work, with gender stereotypes detection, character gender prediction, author gender prediction and gendered character screentime evaluation.
